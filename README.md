# MFBA OOBB Compatible Extras


These parts were commissioned by .:oomlout:. Ltd (http://oomlout.co.uk/) for Maker Faire UK 2015. They were designed by Hexjibber (http://www.hexjibber.com/)

## Repository contents

The fiels are roughly shared in the following formats:

* Adobe Illustrator (source)
* SVG
* PDF
* DXF

The case parts are designed to be laser cut from 3mm sheet MDF.


## Other hardware required

These parts are designed to be compatible with the OOBB Oopen Building Block system. They are designed to be used with M6 hardware - we find M6x12mm bolts and hex nuts work nicely.
